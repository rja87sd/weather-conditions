Week 6 Day 2 Assignment

- In the assignment, we created a class which allows us to create an object or multiple objects with various keys and values. Additionally, we displayed the ability to add methods to the class to manipulate and display the data within the object or objects.

- After this, we created a second class with an extension of the original class. This allows us to add keys and values to the original object without having to go back and repetitively add in each key and its value.

- This provided us with a much more efficient way of creating and manipulating objects and their data.
